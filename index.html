        <h1>Juliet</h1>
        <p>Hi, I am Juliet. Writing has been something that has been lurking over my shoulder for quite a while now,
            and I think now is the time for me to try it out!
            Perhaps it is specific moments in one's life that defines them - this is what I am going to explore. 
            My goal is to tell a story through descriptive peices of moments in a person's life. She will be 
            fantastical and beautiful, ugly and cruel, but hopefully once all is said and done - she will be whole.

        <h1>JARROD</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Jarrod van Schalkwyk, and I am working on honing my digital art skills, specifically 
            in the style of oil painting. For the Alphabet Superset I will be focusing on the theme 
            of Mutation, specifically in the sense of human and animal combinations 
            both in a scientific and fantasy sense. This theme is important to me 
            as I am heavily influenced by fantastical creatures, but also by the 
            spiritual connotations of them.

        <h1>Sean</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm Sean, and I have recently taken a liking to writing a little poetry! My hope for this project is to weave together my poems with some 
            digital sketching, and try to explore a new medium for my creativity that I haven't really attempted before. The poems I'm hoping to write here are 
            intended as an exploration of animism - 
            the practice of seeing the human in the more-than-human world. I hope they're fun to read and prod you in the feely bits occasionally!

        <h1>Rachelle</h1>
        <p>Well hello there! Iâ€™m Rachelle and I really like performing and music (most of my degree at the moment). I love songwriting/composing but struggle with being overly 
            critical and never letting 
            myself finish any pieces. Hopefully doing a whole lot of it over the coming weeks will help me change that :)

        <h1>Dewald</h1>
        <p>Greetings! My name's Dewald, but you can call me "Dew". I dabble in digital art, and I'd love to improve my skills and efficiency with a stylus. During the Alphabet Superset, 
            I'll be taking inspiration from my love of Dungeons & Dragons to create "Dew's Index of Magical Merchandise" (WIP), an old book describing numerous magical items, and how to use them.
