                        She walked along a small path that was the walkway of a local herd. Her feet were bare and touched only the soft sand that had been etched along the grass field. Waves of rich green grass tumbled around her. Her arms lifted slowly as she felt the swell from all the grass that sweetly swayed beside her. A daisy felt the strain first - its white petals sweat as its water was carefully pulled out of its yellow center that was accumulating specks of brown that widened with each breath she took. The white petals started to collapse in on themselves and held on tightly to the browned center. The stalk of the flower now stood hollow and tired. On top of the flower was a small ball of water that started moving towards the woman. One after another, soft leaves turned into hardened corpses. Small trees had their leaves turn from a bright green, to brown, to fallen. 
<br><br>
A dark blue coat of water pulses behind the women, continuing to grow. Her walk was not long, but she had retrieved what was needed. Deep breaths kept the water alongside her, and onwards she walked. Finally, she met a quiet crook where an ancient tree stood. It had been years since she had seen it, and now it looked far less significant and far less proud than she had remembered. In front of it lay cracked dirt and dried algae. A frog lay in a small ball alongside the steaming rocks; its blue skin looking dull and dry. She walked to the center of the empty river, and with an exhale of breath, the water flowed over her. Her eyes closed and her hair flattened in relief. After climbing out, she sat under the tree that she loved so much and watched with pride as the water settled. 
<br><br>
On her walk back, she was forced to face the ocean of brown she had created. The cause was worthy - she was sure of it. But now, as she heard the crunch from fallen leaves, she felt she had caused what she fought: a drought.
