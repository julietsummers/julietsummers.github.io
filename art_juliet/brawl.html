                        She could feel the cold against her back as she sat upon her throne. The hard, sure structure was unforgiving to her body, which had previously been supported by the kindness of flowers and moss. But she was different now, and needed to embrace the marble as a part of herself as it raised her upon its solid grounds to a place that she hoped to reach. The strain ached her body as her muscles along her back grew swollen and hardened, and her eyes hardly blinked as the lines on her face etched themselves deeper and deeper into her skin. 
<br><br>
Her arms were outstretched and stiff, with her hands facing forwards and releasing a grey fog that fell to the floor. It crawled along the ground to meet the circular pit of fog in which it was feeding. Inside, two stone figures were resisting their unnatural moving state. 
<br><br>
Two large tusks were touching the dark sky as it stopped from the force of a strike. Resting proudly on his head, the trunk curved at its steadiness and strength. His old eyes looked down at his opponent: an agile wolf that remained loyal to her fight. Her legs pushed her stone body from the floor that now held a large crack across her chest. With tensed muscles, she moved away from the floor and her pupilless eyes locked on the elephant's neck. Sharp and strong, her jaw wrapped around it with a proud clattering of rocks uniting. With every strike, each animal cracked and crumbled, until there was only the crude shape of a once elegant wolf and mighty elephant. It was clear that the end approached, and as the elephant threw its jagged head towards the wolf's slim body, the fog dissipated in a panicked retreat and the animals crumbled into rubble. 
<br><br>
She sat with her head in her hands, crying softly.
