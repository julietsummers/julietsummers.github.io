                        It was a warm evening and the sun peeked over the horizon, sending goodnight kisses over the forest. Orange and reds danced across the sky and met with the deep blue of the night sky that had flecks of stars waving their hellos. The sun touched the golden trees as they welcomed Autumn. There was a light drizzle that cooled the warmth of the day, and the refreshing smell of rain covered the land like a blanket. Crickets sang in the rejoice of the rain and the end of a joyful summer. It was their rendezvous where she awaited with a soft picking of a fingernail. The last of the sunlight tickled her bare back as her feet felt the soft leaves below. Now, the night sky flickered playfully as the trees deepened in shade. She knew that when she had carefully slipped away to meet in this place of coolness and darkness, her heart would quicken, and muscles would relax. She smiled as a giant green snake appeared from behind the rocky hill beside her. It wrapped up her leg, and then her stomach, and then around her neck.  
                        <br><br>
                        After each breath, it tightened around her. Many would ask why she did it, but to her it was so clear.  In the beginning, she was a queen, straining and fighting for her position to stand tall. Then, a soldier on a battlefield, kneeling before a mighty strike befalls her. And just as her body falls to the earth, she is a lover that has protected their love from a fate most feared. All this she loved, but she was addicted to the release. Her blood raced back through her body and her lungs took in breath much wider than before. Her hands and feet tingled, and the bruises were tender. 
                        <br><br>
                        Her life is warm, and she is cradled, but she knows that a blizzard is how she would come alive.
                        
<br><br>
The glass bowl reflected a face she had not seen before. Her eyes were the blue of a blizzard and now drawn; her cheeks had dark troughs that seemed in tension with her new, sharp cheekbones. Still dyed red from her blood, the alabaster took hold, and her new form was created.
