                        The silence pierced her ears like a pin, slowly making its way throughout her body. Her back arched as she sat on the floor looking forward to a large bowl placed perfectly in front of her. Although she had not touched it yet, its cold started to push into her skin, dying a stain of blue freckles on her arms and cheeks. Within the basket laid rough chunks of alabaster which touched the glass sharply. It was time.
<br><br>
A ghost of her hand started reaching forward towards the first piece of stone. When it touched her skin, a pulse of ice shot through her arm, her neck, her back. It felt like a warning, but one of sick laughter that accompanied it. Now in her hand, she brought it towards her face, where it touched her cheek. Her skin drew in the stone like the ocean pulling in a boat – a hateful acceptance of a thing that does not belong. 
<br><br>
A small knife laid on the marble floor next to her. Its metal hilt reached over a sharp swooping edge. She held it up in front of her face and took a breath – 
<br><br>
Red. 
<br><br>
A piece of stone dropped to the floor after being hacked off her cheek. In its place, a jagged and bloodied curve that created a hollow from the side of her ear to the tip of her mouth. Again. 
<br><br>
Again.
<br><br>
<br><br>
Again.
<br><br>
The glass bowl reflected a face she had not seen before. Her eyes were small and drawn; her cheeks had dark troughs that felt divorced from her new, sharp cheekbones. Still dyed red from her blood, the alabaster took hold, and her new form was created.
