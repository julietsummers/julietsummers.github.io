                        A woman has her earthy hair whisp around her body by the breeze as her feet slowly patter along the grass. As she moves, she feels the soft pickles of green between her toes and along her arches. Her body is draped with a sweetly woven wrap that intertwines with a blue cloth that is bundled close to her chest. Within, lies her newborn baby. Every once in a while, she would meet a particularly enchanting ridge or hill, and her feet would slow for a moment and her eyes would close. She continued. After moving for a little while, she came across an ancient tree that stood protectively over a river. A feeling washed over her like rain on a summer's day, and she approached the tree. It had spots of rough bark all along its trunk and branches; some were starting to fleck off from many seasons of protection, while others were still young soldiers. The summer light beamed down upon the large leaves as the green created a shady area below. The shade broke the shimmer of the clear river from where the sun and water met and left a gentle area for pink fish to play. They hopped out of the water as a dragonfly touched its cheek to the water, and a round frog sat on a rock that was kept at a pleasant warmth from sunrays and the occasional water splashing. Where the river and tree met, an entanglement of roots formed a crib in which she placed her baby.

                    Her tiny arms and legs relaxed onto the knitted roots below, and she felt a soft stream cross over her feet. The silk of algae softened the root or rock wherever she touched, and a yellow bundle of leaves started to form around her. The leaves of the tree seemed to open as a beam of white light broke the shade, looking directly at the baby. She laughed as it touched her skin, and with her laugh, the roots gently tightened in an embrace. The water swelled in a playful swirl across her stomach, and the dragonfly came to kiss the water in front of her.
